# Area = length × breadth - Input: - Length = 6 - Breadth = 4 - Output: - Area of rectangle is: 24
# length=6
# breadth=4
# area=length*breadth
# print(area)

# 3. Area of Triangle
# Question: Calculate the area of a triangle using base and height. - Formula:
# Area = (1/2) × base × height - Input: - Base = 8 - Height = 5 - Output: - Area of triangle is: 20.0
# base=8
# height=5
# area=(1/2)*base*height
# print(area)

# 4. Perimeter of Square
# Question: Calculate the perimeter of a square. - Formula:
# Perimeter = 4 × side - Input: - Side = 6 - Output: - Perimeter of square is: 24
# side=6
# perimeter=4*side
# print(perimeter)

# 5. Perimeter of Rectangle
# Question: Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle. - Formula:
# Perimeter = 2 × (length + breadth) - Input: - Length = 5 - Breadth = 3 - 
# Output: - Perimeter of rectangle is: 16
# len,breadth=5,3
# perimeter=2*(len+breadth)
# print(perimeter)

# 6. Perimeter of Triangle
# Question: Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. - Formula:
# Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3 - Input: - Side1 = 5, Side2 = 6, Side3 = 7 -
# Output: - Perimeter of triangle is: 18
# side1,side2,side3=5,6,7
# perimeter=side1+side2+side3
# print(perimeter)
# 7. Break Amount into 1000s, 500s, and Remaining Change
# Question: Break the total amount into denominations. - 
# Input: - Amount = 3700 - Output: - 1000s: 3 - 500s: 1 - Remaining: 200
# amount=3700
# t=amount//1000
# amount-=t*1000
# f=amount//500
# amount-=f*500
# r=amount
# print("1000s",t)
# print("500s",f)
# print("remaining",r)

# 8. Convert Seconds into Hours, Minutes, and Seconds
# Question: Convert total seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. - Input
# : - Total seconds = 3672 - Output: - Hours: 1 - Minutes: 1 - Seconds: 12
# sec=3672
# h=sec//3600
# sec-=h*3600
# min=sec//60
# sec-=min*60
# print("hours",h)
# print("minutes",min)
# print("seconds",sec)

# 9. Sum of Marks (Maths, Physics, Chemistry)
# Question: Calculate the sum of marks in 3 subjects. 
# - Input: - Maths = 85 - Physics = 90 - Chemistry = 88 - Output: - Total marks: 263
